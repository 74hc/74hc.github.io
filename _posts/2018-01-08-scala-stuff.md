did not have time to fix the issues around this layout, just installed intellij and checked that the scala course documents are ok and set so I can start. well, already started. Hopefully some scala code will be added to a new repo soon. 

Sometimes I have a look to other people's github. At first seems that they have a lot of code on their repos but if you look carefully you end discovering that they are basicly just forking other people and not committing much...
